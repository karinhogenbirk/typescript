## Learning Typescript 
This repo contains code and notes to try out Typescript. By writing this I have learned the basics of Typescript. 
I have practiced the following topics of Typescript: 
- (Abstract) Classes
- Getters and setters
- Interfaces
- Type aliases
- Constructors
- Narrowing
- Discriminated unions
- Generics
The folder 'src' contains all the .ts files, 'dist' the converted .js files.
